1. Check countdown timer to make sure it's using eastern time.  
      - Also, change so it uses actual wedding time instead of just the date.
2. Home page background image should occupy 100vh - height of header - height of CountdownTimer
3. Add validation prior to calling handleSubmit for rsvp form.
4. Add ability to go back steps in RSVP process
5. RSVP help modal should have email template in Collapse container (or with animate.css somehow)
      template should show when user clicks 'See a template'
6. Allow RSVPHelpModal opening from 'Search' step if no guests are found

7. Start with useInView stuff (intersection-observer)
    - highlight location depending on what is in view
