1. Add Registry section
2. Add animated spinner on Casa Feliz on leaflet map.
3. Whole wedding party needs pictures
5. rsvp not quite responsive enough for mobile.
  - Also test auth flow
6. Look up tips for dealing with safari and chrome bottom bars
7. Put gallery image arrows fixed to left/right sides of screen on mobile (<480px)
8. RSVP needs to go in a modal (after searching)
9. Need a favicon for title bar
10. When RSVP modal closes (successfully), show a thank you message where the input used to be.
    - Include a button to show the input in case they need to update/add another rsvp
11. GuestSearch input needs to be split on any amount of whitespace with a regex
    - currently it thinks there are three names if there is more than one space between first and last name


non-code stuff
1. force https to main website (or don't.  Chrome appears to force it on its own.  Worth looking into)
2. make firebase accept traffic only from server port ranges
